  * Current release contains patches from 
   Incorporated patch from Pavel Troller <patrol@sinus.cz> to automatically
   create the device file using udev.  This had to be munged slightly because
   we've apparently changed the interface in 2.6.13-rc kernels. Code tested
   through 2.6.16.  Tested on ia64 RHEL3 & RHEL4, and x86 Debian.
